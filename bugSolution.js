```javascript
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Hello</div>
  );
}

// pages/about.js
export default function About(){
  return(
    <div>About</div>
  );
}
// This solution addresses the issue by restructuring the routing and using the correct methods provided by the App Router to handle navigation, data fetching, and loading states effectively. It also considers the asynchronous nature of client-side data fetching to manage the user experience gracefully.
